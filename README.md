# Budget Tracker
### Zindua School â€“ JavaScript Week 1 Project
You are tasked with building a Budget Tracker using JavaScript. The application should allow users to track their expenses and income while calculating their total balance. This project focuses on JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, and event handling that you've covered so far.

## Budget Tracking Features
- Ability to add income and expenses with a description and amount.
- Ability to view a list of all transactions (income/expenses).
- Ability to remove transactions from the list.
- Display total income, total expenses, and balance dynamically.
- Ability to filter transactions (e.g., show only income or expenses).
- Persist transaction data using cookies to maintain records even after refreshing the page.

## Technical Requirements
To complete this project, you will need to use the following technologies and tools:
- **HTML5:** Structure the webpage for the Budget Tracker.
- **CSS3:** Style the webpage for responsiveness and usability.
- **JavaScript:** Implement the core budget tracking functionality.
- **Cookies:** Store and retrieve data persistently.
- **Git:** Version control with regular commits and meaningful commit messages.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**.

## Project Organisation
### 1. Project Set-Up
- Create an `index.html` file for the UI structure.
- Link a style.css file for styling using plain CSS or a CSS framework of your choise.
- Include a `script.js` file for implementing logic.
### 2. User Interface
- A form with input fields for transaction description and amount.
- A button to add transactions to the list.
- A table or list displaying all transactions, each marked as income or expense.
- A section showing total income, total expenses, and current balance.
- Filter buttons to show all, only income, or only expenses.
### 3. Functionality Implementation
- Use JavaScript functions to add, remove, and display transactions.
- Utilize event listeners for user interactions (e.g., adding and removing transactions).
- Implement loops to iterate over transactions and update the display.
- Use conditional statements to filter transactions.
- Store transactions using cookies for persistence.
### 4. Version Control & Deployment
- Initialize a Git repository and maintain regular commits.
- Deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**.
### 5. Documentation & Best Practices
- Use comments and docstrings to explain functions.
- Maintain a clean code structure for readability.
- Include a `README.md` file with setup instructions and project details.
